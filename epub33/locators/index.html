## Overview

TBW

## Use Cases

 * Susan, a teacher asks her students to go to a certain location in an EPUB file that contains no publisher-provided page list. The students are using different types of reading systems, nevertheless all are able to reach the same page.

 * Ali is a student preparing a bibliography for an essay assignment. Several of his resources are EPUBs, and he wants to reference them accurately, including location of the citation.

 * It's 2046, and everyone is reading EPUBs. Folks in a book club want to share their locations in the text as they discuss the book they are reading. Each person is using a different device to read on, but they are able to share their locations successfully. 

 * Reese, who is reading "The Lottery" in the _Norton Anthology of English Literature_, wants to refer to a specific location in the text when talking to their classmate Kaede, who read the story in _The Collected Works of Shirley Jackson_.

 * Susmitha is an indexer and wants to link a term in an index to its exact location in the book. Note that the term does not necessarily occur on the page verbatim â€” could be a synonym or concept.

 * Piotr wants to link an index entry to a range in the book, meaning that the entry refers to the content beginning at the first location and ending at the second location.

 * Caris is writing and embedding an index for an ebook and needs labels for locator links. The publisher has not provided a page list as this is a digital-only edition. She needs a consistent locator scheme for generating the locations in the index, so generates one using a standard algorithm.
