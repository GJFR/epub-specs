## Introduction

**EPUB 3.3** is a packaging mechanism for web content, designed for electronic books. EPUB's roots go back to 1999, with the OEB 1.0 specification from the Open Ebook Forum (which evolved into the IDPF) In 2007, a packaging format was introduced and OEB became EPUB 2.0. In 2011, EPUB 3.0 added support for XHTML5. Changes since then have been minor. The IDPF was absorbed into W3C in 2017, and responsibility for the maintenance of EPUB fell to the EPUB 3 Community Group, which released EPUB 3.2 in 2019 as a community group note. EPUB is twenty-one years old, but has never gone through the W3C Recommendation track, until now. 

EPUB 3.3 includes the following specifications:

* [EPUB 3.3 Overview](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/overview/), a non-normative overview of EPUB 3.3
* [EPUB 3.3 Core](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/core/), the specification of the file format
* [EPUB 3.3 Reading Systems](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/rs/), the specification for user agents, known as EPUB Reading Systems. 
* [EPUB Accessibility 1.1](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/a11y/)
* [EPUB Accessibility Techniques 1.1](https://w3c.github.io/epub-specs/epub33/a11y-tech/)
