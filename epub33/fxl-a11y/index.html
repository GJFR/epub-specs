## Introduction {#intro}

### Overview {#overview}

Fixed Layout publications, or publications where the print layout is preserved in the digital edition, have been around since before EPUB 3.0.1. These publications span a number of genres and types, from comic books, cook books, children's books, and more.

The main motivation behind creating fixed layout publications is the need to preserve the print layout of the book, either because of it's importance to the text (i.e. complex diagrams) or it's artistic purpose (i.e. illustrated text). However, these publications are often partially or completely inaccessible to people with print disabilities.

This note serves to help content authors and publishers try to address some of the common accessibility issues found in fixed layout content, including navigation, reading order, and text alternatives. This document is a companion to [[EPUB-A11Y-11]], specifically for fixed layout publications. All recommendations made in [[EPUB-A11Y-11]], [[EPUB-33]], and [[EPUB-RS-33]] are applied and extended here.

### The Limits of Fixed Layout Accessibility {#limits}

Fixed Layout publications present some unique challenges for accessibility. The requirements laid out in [[EPUB-A11Y-11]] recommend [[WCAG2]] AA, but for many use cases in fixed layout, that might not be possible without fundamental changes to the content.</p>

We want to recognize these challenges for content creators, and in this document will outline some techniques for managing these challenges. We encourage content creators to explore the possibilities that digital publications present, even when creating fixed layout publications.</p>

## Reading Order {#reading-order}

> "A key concept of EPUB is that an EPUB Publication consists of multiple resources that can be completely navigated and
> consumed by a person or program in some specific order." - 1.2.1 Reading Order [[EPUB-OVERVIEW-33]]

Whereas many reflowable publications have an obvious reading order, or logical progression through their content, fixed-layout publications are often more complex in their design and layout and may consist of multiple readable objects on the same page.

For viewers of the visual page, the reading order can be inferred by various visual triggers including:

 * Size and styles of font used
 * Design features such as imagery and coloured backgrounds
 * Position on the page top to bottom, left to right (when using left to right page progression)

In addition, there may be additional text and image objects on the fixed-layout page which are not required to be included in reading order, such as:

 * page numbers
 * section or chapter headings
 * other purely decorative objects

### The Page Position Problem {#reading-order-position}

For complex designs, the position of objects on the fixed-layout page is not a reliable indicator of their reading order.

![In the example page above, the top level heading is inferred by its styling rather than its position. The step-by-step are reading across left to right but in two rows.](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_0AAB5B58D7ED490A2ECD81A9EF48D7CA8161EC26CC0E062275C355EA1B8AAB1F_1620130508735_image.png)

![The correct reading order indicated with overlaid regions.](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_0AAB5B58D7ED490A2ECD81A9EF48D7CA8161EC26CC0E062275C355EA1B8AAB1F_1620131709989_image.png)

> In a multi-column document, the linear presentation of the content flows from the top of a column to the bottom of the column, then to the top of the next column.

[Example from Understanding Success Criterion 1.3.2: Meaningful Sequence](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/meaningful-sequence)

### The Stacking Order Problem {#reading-order-stacking}

The default reading order for Text to Speech (TTS) is determined by the order of the elements in the XHTML page (DOM). Popular page layout programs like Adobe InDesign and Apple Pages export the page content in the order of the stacking order of objects on the page rather than their page position. The topmost objects sits above other objects and so is written last in the HTML.

![The stacking order is commonly used by layout applications to dictate the reading order.](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_0AAB5B58D7ED490A2ECD81A9EF48D7CA8161EC26CC0E062275C355EA1B8AAB1F_1620137557760_InDesign_stack.png)

The design above would be rendered in reverse reading order.

```html
<body style="width:595px;height:842px">
    <div style="width:500px;height:200px;top:400px;position:absolute; … ">
        <p …>Bottom object</p>
    </div>
    <div style="width:500px;height:200px;top:225px;position:absolute; … ">
        <p …>Middle object</p>
    </div>
    <div style="width:500px;height:200px;top:50px;position:absolute; … ">
        <p …>Top object</p>
    </div>
</body>
```

### Altering the Reading Order {#reading-order-changing}

> If a blind user, who reads the page with a screen reader that follows the source order, is working with a sighted user who reads the page in visual order, they may be confused when they encounter information in different orders. A user with low vision who uses a screen magnifier in combination with a screen reader may be confused when the reading order appears to skip around on the screen. A keyboard user may have trouble predicting where focus will go next when the source order does not match the visual order.

*From Making the DOM order match the visual order*
https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/css/C27

Automatic exports can derive their reading order either by analysing the position of the page and / or the stacking order in order to influence the reading order. Neither is suitable. Altering the stacking order to dictate the reading order has the potential to alter and disrupt the design of the page.

![Altering the stacking order will the alter reading order but may also disrupt the design of the page.](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_0AAB5B58D7ED490A2ECD81A9EF48D7CA8161EC26CC0E062275C355EA1B8AAB1F_1620136528766_Screenshot+2021-05-04+at+14.55.18.png)

<aside class="note">
    
The Adobe InDesign articles panel, which can be used to define the reading order of reflowable EPUB and PDF exports, has no effect on fixed-layout EPUB from Adobe InDesign.

The recommended best practice solution is to adjust the order of the elements in the XHTML page and to preserve the design using CSS z-index.

</aside>

```html
<body style="width:595px;height:842px">
    <div style="z-index:3;width:500px;height:200px;top:50px;position:absolute; … ">
        <p …>Top object</p>
    </div>
    <div style="z-index:2;width:500px;height:200px;top:225px;position:absolute; … ">
        <p …>Middle object</p>
    </div>
    <div style="z-index:1;width:500px;height:200px;top:400px;position:absolute; … ">
        <p …>Bottom object</p>
    </div>
</body>
```

### Removing items from the Reading Order {#reading-order-removing}

There may be cases when text appears on the page but is unnecessary, duplicated or otherwise confusing for it to be added to the reading order. e.g. page numbers, section or chapter headings which are already part of the publication’s structure or text used for visual effects.

> Adding aria-hidden="true" will remove the entire element from the accessibility API.

From Using the aria-hidden attribute
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_aria-hidden_attribute

```html
<div aria-hidden="true">
    <p class="folio">210</p>
</div>
```

### Reading Order across the ‘fold’ {#reading-order-spreads}

Fixed-layout documents can be presented as ‘synthetic spreads’ when a left and right page are presented together as a spread. As each page of the fixed-layout document is a separate XHTML document it is expected that reading order moves through there document from left to right (when using left to right page progression) but is not possible for the reading order to move from the left to the right and then back to the left page again.

If the text must be read in this way, the only solution to maintain the correct reading order is to convert the double page spread in to a single landscape page that contains the entire content of the spread and for the EPUB to be rendered as single pages.

## Tables {#tables}

An image of text, or images with text, are not accessible. It is important to try to avoid images of text whenever possible, which is more of a challenge in FXL.

The best way to create an accessible table is to present it as tabular data. This is already documented in the DAISY Knowledge Base with directions on creating [semantic tagging for tables](http://kb.daisy.org/publishing/docs/html/tables.html).

If the table needs to remain an image, another option is to use alt-text and caption or ARIA roles to describe the data in logical reading order. The caption could be used as a summary of the table, and the Alt-text would dive deeper. You would start with describing what the header row is followed by what is presented in each row. You could then dive deeper and list all the data as it appears in reading order.

Depending on the complexity of the image this may require complex description with one of the following formats:

 * Providing a long description in text near the non-text content, with a reference to the location of the long description in the short description
 * Providing a long description in another location with a link to it that is immediately adjacent to the non-text content
 * Providing long description for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information
 * Extended description in details
 * Using hidden description (see example 4)

### ARIA Roles for Tables {#tables-aria}

Provide an extended description for a table using either [aria-describedby or aria-details](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/ARIA15.html).

<aside class="ednote">
    
The advantage of aria-details over aria-describedby is that it allows users access to the markup of the linked description (which could be the table markup if you put it, for example, inside a details element to collapse it). The current drawback, however, is that there isn't great support yet for the attribute. And expanding details element within a fixed layout page is also likely to wreak a bit of havoc when users click on it (unless you find a way to reliably position it offscreen, but then that limits who can access it).

The aria-describedby attribute's big drawback is that it turns the description into one long text string that users have to listen to. There's no way to navigate the columns and rows or have headers read out, so it's likely going to be very difficult for users to make sense of except for very simple and very small tables.

## Accessibility metadata {#a11y-metadata}

Books with accessible elements require metadata to indicate how they are accessible, and if they present and hazards to the reader.

`accessibilityFeature` and `accessModeSufficient` should be used for FXL titles.
