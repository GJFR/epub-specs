                <h3>Overview</h3>
                
                <p>Fixed Layout publications, or publications where the print layout is preserved in the digital edition, have been around since before EPUB 3.0.1. These publications span a number of genres and types, from comic books, cook books, children's books, and more.</p>

                <p>The main motivation behind creating fixed layout publications is the need to preserve the print layout of the book, either because of it's importance to the text (i.e. complex diagrams) or it's artistic purpose (i.e. illustrated text). However, these publications are often partially or completely inaccessible to people with print disabilities.</p>

                <p>This note serves to help content authors and publishers try to address some of the common accessibility issues found in fixed layout content, including navigation, reading order, and text alternatives. This document is a companion to [[EPUB-A11Y-11]], specifically for fixed layout publications. All recommendations made in [[EPUB-A11Y-11]], [[EPUB-33]], and [[EPUB-RS-33]] are applied and extended here. </p>

                <h3>The Limits of Fixed Layout Accessibility</h3>

                <p>Fixed Layout publications present some unique challenges for accessibility. The requirements laid out in [[EPUB-A11Y-11]] recommend [[WCAG2]] AA, but for many use cases in fixed layout, that might not be possible without fundamental changes to the content.</p>

                <p>We want to recognize these challenges for content creators, and in this document will outline some techniques for managing these challenges. We encourage content creators to explore the possibilities that digital publications present, even when creating fixed layout publications.</p>
